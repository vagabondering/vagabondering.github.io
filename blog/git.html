        Having to learn Git, a versioning control workflow, I can see how great the benefits are in usage for coding. As coding is highly experimental, the work can be saved and backed constantly with incremented versions. Having the code backed up gives you the freedom to add and test codes, without having to worry about breaking anything because you can quickly revert to the latest working version. Git allows you to compare the versions with each other so you can see the content differences.
        It's also a great way to analyze and see the growth of the code workflow.

      <p>
        Git commit is the process of saving the work and turning it to its own version. Each version becomes a backup of the code.
        You have to tie a message with the Git commit process. The content of the message should be clear and descriptive about the changes made to the code. If your code is being merged with another's, it's essential that the coder understands the changes.

      <p>
        On top of using Git, there's also GitHub. GitHub is an online hub that connects Git users to share and merge their codes. It also acts as a cloud storage for the codes with room to do several incremented saved versions.
