    How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
    It was nice to have another person's input about my wireframe and HTML page.

    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
    The wireframing is a bit helpful to help organize the layout.

    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
    We decided that a good wireframe is to keep it simple and not go crazy with details and small stuff.

    What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
    I didn't learn any new ones.
