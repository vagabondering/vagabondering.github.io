      <li>What is an array?</li><br>
      An array is a list of ordered collections of values that can consist of numbers and/or strings. The structure of an array is set up with square brackets, array = [].
      <p><li>What is a hash?</li></p>
      A hash in the ruby language is a collection of key-value pairs. It's kind of like a dictionary where the key is the word and the value is the definition of the word.
      The structure consists of key1 => value1, key2 => value2 etc. You can have an empty hash, add and remove keys from the hash.
      </ul>
      <p>Both arrays and hashes stores data, however the difference is how the values are accessed. In an array, the value is accessed by an index number, whereas in a hash, you can call it by its key name. For example, to access the third item in this array list array = [1, 2, 3, 4], you call it by using a integer, array[2].
      As for a hash, to access the second value of this one, hash = {"key1" => value1, "key2" => value 2, "key3" => value3}, you call the index by its key, hash["key2"].
