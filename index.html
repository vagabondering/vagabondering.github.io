<!--
-How was your experience translating a wireframe into HTML?

I think overall this experience was challenging in a way that I feel lost about what I have to create for content, it would have been nice to see some past examples.

-What new tricks or elements did you learn about in HTML?

I learned to make tabs.

-Are you excited to start incorporating the design you chose next week?

I would probably be more excited to incorporate another person's design that's better designed and more inspiring.
