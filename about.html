Here's a brief biography about me:
<p>
I was born and raised in Sweden, yes Sweden...And yes I was surrounded by blondes. Anyhow, my family decided to move us to Canada when I was a teenager so I'm also Canadian. I came to US for work after I finished college - so here I am!
</p><p>
What I love about living in California are the mountains that I can hike on. I also adore the water sceneries here. Besides hiking and taking long walks and observing beautiful sceneries, I enjoy yoga, movies, exploring new restaurants and learning new things, whether it's coding, a new software, about a new place etc, I just love gaining new information.
</p>
<p>
What brought me to California was a job at a pretty large Animation Studio. I went to art school that specialized in Animation and 3D graphics. Coming from an art background, I got involved in the technical part of graphics at work where they used a proprietary software. It started out old school where we had to copy and paste script contents to create and execute a certain operator on an object. And because it was proprietary and constantly evolving to adapt to new implementations, things always broke and tons of debugging was involved. I'm grateful that I focused on math in high school because it helped contribute to my problem solving ability.

I've been involved with fine arts for almost my whole life but I'm also a bit of a science geek, I could spend hours on the IFLScience website. I suppose that's a quirky fact about me!
